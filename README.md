# AAC App

This is an augmentative and alternative communication app built in React. It uses the AWS Polly service to convert text to speech. It is hosted on AWS and uses S3 for file storage. AWS Lambda and API Gateway are used to create functions triggered by API calls. DynamoDB is used to store data, and Cognito is used for authentication.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you will need to have an AWS account and configure your credentials. You will also need to install Node.js and the AWS CLI.

Once you have the necessary tools installed, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies:

       git clone https://github.com/your-username/aac-app.git
       cd aac-app
       npm install ```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
